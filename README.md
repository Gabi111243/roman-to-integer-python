## Introduction

Roman numerals have been used for centuries and are still relevant today. This project aims to bridge the gap between ancient numeral systems and modern programming. By converting Roman numerals to integers, you can easily perform calculations and data manipulations.

## Installation

To get started with this project, you need to have Python 3.8 or higher installed on your machine. You can download Python from the official website: [Python Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Once you have Python installed, you can clone this repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Gabi111243/roman-to-integer-python.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd roman-to-integer-python
```

You can also install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To convert a Roman numeral to an integer, simply run the script from the command line. You can provide the Roman numeral as an argument:

```bash
python roman_to_integer.py X
```

This will output:

```
10
```

You can also test various Roman numerals by running the script multiple times with different inputs.

## Features

- **Beginner-Friendly**: The code is simple and easy to understand, making it suitable for beginners.
- **Educational**: Learn about Roman numerals and their conversion process.
- **Command-Line Tool**: Easily convert Roman numerals from the command line.
- **Open Source**: Contribute to the project and improve it further.
- **Data Structures**: Understand how to use dictionaries and lists effectively.

## Algorithm

The algorithm used in this project is straightforward. Here’s a brief overview:

1. **Mapping**: Create a mapping of Roman numerals to their integer values.
2. **Iteration**: Iterate through the Roman numeral string from left to right.
3. **Comparison**: If the current numeral is less than the next numeral, subtract its value. Otherwise, add its value.
4. **Return Result**: After processing the entire string, return the total value.

Here is a simple code snippet that illustrates the algorithm:

```python
def roman_to_integer(s: str) -> int:
    roman_map = {
        'I': 1,
        'V': 5,
        'X': 10,
        'L': 50,
        'C': 100,
        'D': 500,
        'M': 1000
    }
    
    total = 0
    prev_value = 0
    
    for char in reversed(s):
        value = roman_map[char]
        if value < prev_value:
            total -= value
        else:
            total += value
        prev_value = value
    
    return total
```
